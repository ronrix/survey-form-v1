# Assignment #2

# Instructions

1.	Get the codes from here to your personal repository.
2.	From local repository, get your files in personal repository.
3.	As you’ll notice, project’s unit tests cause failure. Supply the logic in model file to make the unit tests succeed. (Remember to do local testing BEFORE introducing new codes to remote)
4.	Make the code changes reflect to personal repository. 
5.	Pass the code changes to remote repository using pull-request.

Good luck!
